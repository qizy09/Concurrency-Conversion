/* Except for the requirements, I made some extra improvements to this assignment
 * 1. Except for when button is clicked, when the input value is changed in the text filed, my app is gonna update the results automatically
 * 2. Except for the already supported currencies, I also added Chinese Yuan, which was previously not supported by the CRCurrencyRequest API.
 * 3. In this assignment, I obeyed the programming routines described in the video, i.e. make declarations and imports in the ".h" file, rather than in this ".m" file.
